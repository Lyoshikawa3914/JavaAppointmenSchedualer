WGU Software II C195
Languages: Java, MySQL

The purpose of this project was to create an app that accumulated all the Java information from this course.
This application uses a simple user interface that schedules appointments for customers using MySQL to add, update,
delete, and create data about the customer and the appointment.

This login screen will be password protected, where the user must have matching username and passwords to
access the application.

The additional report in part A3f tracks how many customers are within each country followed by how many
customers are within each division. This information can be used to figure out the companies demographics within a region
